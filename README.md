### What I learned

postioning that color image at the top left corner and bottom right corner.
How to postion an image better with not only postion relative and  position absolute

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css main{
    background-color: hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    padding-left: 2rem;
    padding-right: 2rem;
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css main .top-pic{
    width: 380px;
    position: absolute;
    top: -110px;
    left: -180px;
    
}
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css main .bottom-pic{
    width: 380px;
    height: auto;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: -70px;
    right: -200px;
}
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css section{
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 10px 10px 10px 10px;
    z-index: 1;
}
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css section .image{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
    position: relative;
}
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css .image img{ 
    position: absolute;
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    top: -55px;
    border-radius: 100%;
    border: 4px solid white;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
